<font color= FBB2FF ><h3>Who are we?</h3></font>
<p>The WAWM Shining Strings are an advanced group of string players. The musicians in this group range from 6th grade, all the way through 12th grade. </p>
<p>The Shining Strings group plays gigs and concerts in the West Allis and Milwaukee area. Last year, in the 2016/2017 season, we played at a tea party and at a middle school concert.</p>
<font color= FBB2FF ><h2>What type of music/what instruments do we play?</h2></font>
<p>The sections of our orchestra are 1st violin (melody), 2nd violin (harmoney/backup), viola, cello, and bass. We play a wide variety of music, from pop, to classics, to rock, the Shining Strings group has something for everyone. A shining strings classic is the Lady Gaga Hit Mix arranged by Larry Moore. It is a mash-up of three of Lady Gaga's biggest hits, Poker Face, Bad Romance, and Just Dance. We play this particular song at every single gig we do. </p>
